HISTORY (CITED FROM A.TØNNESEN MASTER THESIS, AUG 2004)

Work  on the olsrd implementation was started spring 2003. At first the
plan was to add and experiment with MID functionality in  the  existing
draft3[1]  compatible  OLSR  implementation  by INRIA[2]. This was com‐
pleted by summer 2003. This means that much olsrd code  originally  was
based  on  the  INRIA implementation. But since then, close to all code
has been rewritten or heavily modified. Olsrd is  therefore  considered
an  independent  OLSR  implementation  and not just an extension to the
INRIA implementation. [...]

In October 2003 RFC3626 was released and now full RFC compliance became
the  goal of the project. In November 2003 UniK olsrd version 0.2.0 was
made public available through a website. But full RFC  core  compliance
was  not  reached  until  release 0.3.8 in January 2004. Not much later
0.4.0 was released. It covered all  auxiliary  functionality  as  well,
except link-layer notifications. [...]

Andreas Tønnesen <andretoæolsr.org>
       Active  2003-2006: Funder of the project, active contributor and
       maintainer until 2007, still owning the  domain  olsr.org.  Also
       created the dotdraw, dyn_gw, httpinfo, and secure plugins. While
       Andreas Tønnesen published  the  original  implementation  under
       GPLv2,  he  as well as all other contributors switched to BSD in
       Nov 2004.

FURTHER HISTORY (WOS-03 TO OLSRD-NG)

In Juli 2004, Andreas Tønnesen presented his implementation on the Wiz‐
ards  of  OS 03[3] conference in Berlin. He met a couple of free public
network activists from the C-Base[4]  /  Freifunk[5]  community.  While
some of them tried to test wireless mobility cycling around the confer‐
ence center with a moped, others established  a  general  agreement  of
cooperation.  This  leads  to  several  contributors to jump in, namely
(AFAICR, please add yourself if your name is missing or sort  the  list
if you think you’re in the wrong position):

Thomas Lopatic <thomasælopatic.de>

       solved lots of implementation issues, created  the  Windows  GUI
       and maintained the olsrd code base as well.

Bruno Randolf <br1æeinfach.org>
       Active   2004-2005:  Solved  lots  of  wireless  driver/hardware

OLSRD-NG HISTORY (STILL ACTIVE)

In late 2006, the Vienna based Funkfeuer[8] community  managed  to  get
some  sponsoring  from  IPA[9].  They  established the OLSRD-NG project
which should basically lead to a much larger node count and better code
quality (see Funkfeuer Wiki on OLSRD-NG[10]). This in turn attracts new
developers for the somewhat silenced team from there on:

Aaron Kaplan <aaronælo-res.org>
       Active  2005-[...]:  Initiator/Coordinator   of   the   OLSRD-NG
       project, contributed bug fixes (BSD, MacOS) and documentation.

Bernd Petrovitsch <berndæfirmix.at>
       Active  2006-[...]:  Patch-juggler  for  the  olsrd  repository,
       rewrote the build system (Makefiles) and plugin subsystem,  gen‐
       eralized  commonly  used  code  and functions, also lots of code
       base maintenance and bug fixes as well.

Hannes Gredler <hannesægredler.at>
       Active 2007-[...] Contributed the SPF refactoring (routing  code
       optimization),  code  refactorings  for scheduler and nearly all
       internal data structures, code base maintenance and  bug  fixes.
       Currently also hosts the mercurial repository.

Henning Rogge <roggeæfgan.de>
       Active  2008-[...]:  Reworked  the LQ/ETX algorithm, contributed
       the netsimcap (network simulation,  GPL),  changed  logging  and
       data  structures,  also  lots  of  code base maintenance and bug
       fixes.

Markus Kittenberger <Markus.Kittenbergerægmx.at>
       Active 2008-[...]: Policy routing changes.
