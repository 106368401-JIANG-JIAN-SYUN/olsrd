Document a little bit the latest changes for the OS refactoring
===============================================================




moved OS sepcfic includes to src/os_*.h
deleted and renamed many .h files


os_system.h:


  /* called very soon ! any static intializations for the OS go here */
  void os_init(void);

  /* called shortly before olsrd quits . Called very late */
  void os_cleanup(void);
   


os_net.h:

renamed all olsr_$function to os_$function . For example olsr_sendto() -> os_sendto().


/* called very early while initialization of the interface */
int os_init_interface(struct interface *, struct olsr_if_config *);

/* called very late while cleaning up of the interface */
void os_cleanup_interface(struct interface *);



os_kernel_routes.h:

int os_route_add_rtentry(const struct rt_entry *, int);
int os_route_del_rtentry(const struct rt_entry *, int);


os_time.h:


  11 #include <sys/time.h>
  12 #include "defs.h"
  13 
  14 int EXPORT(os_gettimeofday)(struct timeval *TVal, void *TZone);
  15 void EXPORT(os_sleep)(unsigned int Sec);
  16 int EXPORT(os_nanosleep)(struct timespec *Req, struct timespec *Rem);


These are actually posix functions.
Because they are exported, these can be interfaced with the event based simulator :))
