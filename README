1. OLSR RFC COMPLIANCE

  Olsrd is RFC3626 compliant. Most RFC realted definitions can be found 
  in the olsr_protocol header file.


2. EXTENTIONS

  This version also has some extentions which are part of other projects:

  Plugins:

  - Secure OLSR plugin. This plugin adds a signature to all messages
    to ensure data integrity. This way only nodes with access to the
    shared key can participate in the routing.
    The key is read as the first 128 bits from /root/.olsr/olsrd_secure_key
    You need to have the OpenSSL libs installed to use this plugin.

  - Powerplugin. A plugin that uses OLSRs MPR flooding to spread information
    about the powerstatus of nodes.

  - Dynamic Internet gateway. A plugin that dynamically adds and removes Internet
    HNA transmissions based on if there exists a default gateway to Internet
    with hopcount = 0(non OLSR gateway).

  Built in:

  - IPC to GUI front-end. A gui front-end can connect to the daemon
    if started with the -ipc switch or set in the configfile.


3. COMPILING & INSTALLING

  The makefile is updated in this version.
  To install to a directoy different from / use INSTALL_PREFIX=targetdir
  To use other compilers set CC=yourcompiler
  All this can be done on the command line(or in scripts), so there should
  not be any need to update the Makefile for different environments.

  These changes also go for the pluginmakefiles.

  To compile:
  'make OS=targetos'

  To install(you must be root):
  'make install'

  This also installs the standard configuration file((PREFIXDIR)/etc/olsrd.conf)
  YOU MUST EDIT THIS FILE!

  To clean up object files run
  'make clean'


  To compile and install the power plugin:
  cd lib/power
  make; make install

  To compile and install the dynamic GW plugin:
  cd lib/dyn_gw
  make; make install

4. CONFIGURING & RUNNING:

  OBS!!!!
  Edit the configuration file to fit your needs.

  Options in the config file can also be overridden by command line 
  options. See the manual pages olsrd(8) and olsrd.conf(5) for details.

  To run the daemon you MUST specify which interface(s) to use either in
  the config file or by using the -i option.

  The binary is named 'olsrd' and is installed in (PREFIX)/usr/sbin. 
  You must have root privelegies to run olsrd!

  To run the daemon in the background you can either start olsrd
  with the '-d 0' switch or set DEBUG to 0 in the config file.

  To use plugins add them to the configfile as explained in the file.

  4.1 SOME COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS:

  DEPRECATED
  See the manpage for command line options.

5. BUGS

  Problems have been reported when running in daemon mode(DEBUG 0). If this
  causes problems and you need to run olsrd in the background you could
  just redirect output to /dev/null( > /dev/null)


6. FRONT-END

  These are instructions to build the Linux GTK-based GUI.

  6.1 COMPILING

    To compile:
    cd linux-gui
    make
    The binary is put in the bin directory

  6.2 RUNNING

    To run simply:
    cd bin
    ./olsrd-gui
 
    REMEMBER olsrd must be started using the -ipc switch or the
    IPC option must be set to yes to be able to use the GUI front-end

  6.3 BUGS
