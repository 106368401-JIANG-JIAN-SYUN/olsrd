ARPROAMING PLUGIN FOR OLSRD
by amadeus (amadeus@chemnitz.freifunk.net)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
PLUGIN PARAMETERS (PlParam)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Interface: Network device to use for roaming plugin
Timeout: Time in seconds for disconnected clients until they get
	removed	from list (since they are no longer responding)

Important note: Very low timeouts (< 5s) are probably flooding your
	network	or causing service interruption if you have a lot of
	clients on a single device.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLE CONFIG
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Add in /etc/olsrd.conf:

LoadPlugin "arproaming.so.0.1"
{
 PlParam "Interface" "wlan0"
 PlParam "Timeout" "10"
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPLANATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

>> What:
Imagine the following situation on olsr driven networks:

 [NODE: Alice]  <------------------------>  [NODE: Bob]

      [CLIENT: Dude]

Configuration:
 * Alice: 10.0.0.1/22, 10.0.3.254/32, OLSRD (255.255.255.255)
 * Bob: 10.0.0.2/22, 10.0.3.254/32, OLSRD (255.255.255.255)
 * Dude: 10.0.1.1/22, gateway: 10.0.3.254

The client Dude is connected with Alice using his wireless
connection. An IP address has been assigned (static or DHCP).
(Dude is not running any routing software.)

If Dude is moving on to Bob he will probably use his AP to
connect (since the network is sharing the same bssid).

Now this is the part where 'arproaming' comes into play. It will detect
that Dude is now using Bob's AP and as a result Dude's IP address
will be announced through HNA table to all nodes running olsrd.

Using the specified timeout value from olsrd config file the plugin
periodically asks if the client is still there (arp requests).
If no longer responding its IP address will be removed from HNA.

Note: Using 10.0.3.254 on all nodes as a gateway will ensure outgoing
client connections are still feasible.

>> Why:
You can jump from AP to AP using the same IP address without service
interruption (depending how fast HNA spreads out).

>> Features:
Flap detection avoids fast changing HNA entries between node
neighbors (not implemented yet). Garbage collection wipes out possible
identical entries for client MAC addresses on different IPs.

>> Possible problems:
Every connected client creates a HNA entry which could be an issue
when having tons of clients. Also every client creates an arp
request on associated AP due to timeout checks.

>> Source:
The project is currently hosted on SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/olsr-arproaming/

>> Use:
LoadPlugin "lib/arproaming/olsrd_arproaming.so.0.1"
{
 PlParam "Interface" "wlan0"
 PlParam "Timeout" "10"
}

>> Difference to olsrd-cl:
I'm sure everyone is aware of the already working roaming implemention
called 'olsrd-c'l by ralisi. Now 'arproaming' is not patching olsrd
itself nor is it relying on dnsmasq lease files or web servers used to
share them.
