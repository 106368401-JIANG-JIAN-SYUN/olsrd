ABOUT

Plugin is IPv4 only!

This is a plugin that checks if the local node has a Internet-
connection. A Internet-connetion is identified by a "default gw"
with a hopcount of 0. That is a route to 0.0.0.0/0 with metric 0.

Since OLSR uses hopcount/metric on all routes this plugin will
not respond to Internet gateways added by olsrd.

When a Internet gateway is discovered - this node will start
announcing 0.0.0.0/0 connectivity by HNA messages flooded into
the OLSR network. If the route is removed the HNA messages
will not be transmitted. This check is totally dynamic and
Internet connectivity might come and go. The check for connectivity
is done every 5 seconds.

This plugin will work very good with a automatic network cable
detection daemon such as  netplug:

telet to 127.0.0.1 port 9999
for IPC messages


This plugin is a good example of using plugins for other stuff
than packet transmission.
