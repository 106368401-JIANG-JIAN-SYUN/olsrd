HTTP MINI-SERVER PLUGIN FOR OLSRD 0.1
by Andreas Tonnesen(andreto@olsr.org)

-----------------------------------------------------

 ABOUT

This plugin implements a tiny HTTP server that
will gespond to a GET request by returning a HTML
formatted page contanin various information about
the currently running olsrd process.
This information includes detailed link status for
all links and neighbors, all olsrd routes in the 
kernel, local configuration, uptime and more. The
plugin can also generate a olsrd configfile based
on current running configuration.
In adittion an experimental administrtion interface
is available.

-----------------------------------------------------

 PARAMETERS

The plugin takes the parameter "Port" "[portnumber]" 
to set the TCP port on which the server is to run. 
It defaults to 1978.
Now remember to open this port in your firewall if 
planning to access the HTTP server from a remote host!

The access to the plugin is controlled by two lists of ip
addresses and ip networks, a blacklist (reject list) and
a whitelist (accept list). Two binary flags control which
list is to be used first and what should be the default
reaction to an unknown IP.

Examples for parameters accept/reject:
PlParam   "accept"   "10.0.0.0/8" 
PlParam   "reject"   "10.0.0.1" 
PlParam   "accept"   "10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0" 

Examples for parameters for binary flags
PlParam   "checkfirst"      "reject"
PlParam   "defaultpolicy"   "accept"

The old parameters "host", "host4", "host6", "net", "net4"
and "net6" are just alias names for "accept".

The default settings are checkfirst=reject and
defaultpolicy=reject.


A configuration example:
LoadPlugin "olsrd_httpinfo.so.0.1"
{
    PlParam     "port"          "80"
    PlParam     "checkfirst"    "reject"
    PlParam     "defaultpolicy" "accept"
    PlParam     "accept"   "10.0.0.0/8"
    PlParam     "reject"   "10.0.1.123"
}

This will run the webserver on port 80(the normal
HTTP port) and allow access from the network
10.0.0.0/8, but not from 10.0.1.123.
access is always allowed from 127.0.0.1(localhost).

-----------------------------------------------------

 EXPERIMENTAL ADMIN INTERFACE

The plugin can be compiled with a experimental 
adminitrator interface. This is a web page that will
let the user change olsrd settings in realtime.
To compile with this feature pass ADMIN_INTERFACE=1
as an argument to make(eg. make ADMIN_INTERFACE=1)

-----------------------------------------------------

NOTE!
This plugin is very olsrd version sensitive. This means
that to be sure everything woks as it is supposed to
you should use the version of olsrd that the plugin 
was shipped with. If using CVS you should check 
out/update both olsrd and this plugin.

The plugin should now compile on windows and FreeBSD
as well.
To compile in windows:
make OS=win32
to compile in FreeBSD:
gmake OS=fbsd

installation:
make
make install
