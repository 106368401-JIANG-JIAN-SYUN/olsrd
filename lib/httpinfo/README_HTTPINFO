HTTP MINI-SERVER PLUGIN FOR OLSRD 0.1
by Andreas Tønnesen(andreto@olsr.org)

This plugin implements a tiny HTTP server that
will gespond to a GET request by returning a HTML
formatted page contanin various information about
the currently running olsrd process.

The plugin takes one parameter "Port" to set the
TCP port on which the server is to run. It defaults
to 8080.
Now remember to open this port in your firewall if 
planning to access the HTTP server from a remote host!

NOTE!
If running olsrd 0.4.8, the plugin will not be able
to display the link set. Use CVs version of olsrd
if you need this functionallity.

The plugin should now compile on windows as well.
Do:
make OS=win32


installation:
make
make install
