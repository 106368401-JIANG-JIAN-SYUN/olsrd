HTTP MINI-SERVER PLUGIN FOR OLSRD

I only just started work on this plugin yesterday.
It's in CVS so that I can work on it from multiple
locations - it's not very usable to anyone right now...

Still - if you want to try it - set olsrd to load it
and point your webbrowser to 
http://127.0.0.1:8080
to access from you local host. Remote access is also
allowed. I think this can be a cool feature for
embedded devices :)


installation:
make
make install
