NAMESERVICE PLUGIN FOR OLSRD
by Bruno Randolf <bruno.randolf@4g-systems.biz>

a simple DNS replacement for OLSR networks

this plugin distributes host name information over OLSR
and writes a file in /etc/hosts format. this file can be 
used to resolve hostnames on the local system and/or be
read by a DNS server like "dnsmasq", to make the names 
available via ordinary DNS to other clients as well.

the default location of the hosts file is
/var/run/hosts_olsr 

PLUGIN PARAMETERS

"name"		the name of the OLSR node

"filename"	which file to write to 
		(default: /var/run/hosts_olsr)
