 PARAMETERS

The plugin takes the parameter "Port" "[portnumber]" 
to set the TCP port on which the server is to run. 
It defaults to 2006.

The access to the plugin is controlled by two lists of ip
addresses and ip networks, a blacklist (reject list) and
a whitelist (accept list). Two binary flags control which
list is to be used first and what should be the default
reaction to an unknown IP.

Examples for parameters accept/reject:
PlParam   "accept"   "10.0.0.0/8" 
PlParam   "reject"   "10.0.0.1" 
PlParam   "accept"   "10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0" 

Examples for parameters for binary flags
PlParam   "checkfirst"      "reject"
PlParam   "defaultpolicy"   "accept"

The old parameters "host", "host4", "host6", "net", "net4"
and "net6" are just alias names for "accept".

The default settings are checkfirst=reject and
defaultpolicy=reject.


A configuration example:
LoadPlugin "olsrd_txtinfo.so.0.1"
{
    PlParam     "port"          "80"
    PlParam     "checkfirst"    "reject"
    PlParam     "defaultpolicy" "accept"
    PlParam     "accept"   "10.0.0.0/8"
    PlParam     "reject"   "10.0.1.123"
}

This will run the txtinfo server on port 80(the normal
HTTP port) and allow access from the network
10.0.0.0/8, but not from 10.0.1.123.
access is always allowed from 127.0.0.1(localhost).

For CSV-Mode just add /csv to your query and receive
a comma separated output. You can also use more than
one flag to query the plugin. The parameters can be
in any order.
e.g.: /csv/link/route
