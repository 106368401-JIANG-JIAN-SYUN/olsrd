# Specify the routing Table olsr uses

# useful for policyrouting, to ensure that olsr can use 
# the table a policy rule with priority 65536 is auto-installed
# by olsrd if an value < 253 ist specified!
# value defaults to 253 (main table)
# valid values are 1 .. 254
# (freifunkfirmware uses 111 for its policy routing)

# RtTable 111

#you may specify another table for the default route only
#if used no policy route will get auto-installed for this table, 
#but the default route gets also inserted into table 254 
#(the last table used in default linux policy routing)
#valid tables are the same as for RtTable

# RtTableDefault 112

# Specify the proto tag to be used for routes olsr inserts into kernel
# currently only implemented for linux, (bsd is planned)
# defaults to 0 which gets replaced by an OS-specific default value
# under linux 3 (BOOT) gets used as default (for backward compatibility)
# under bsd 1 will get used
# valid values under linux are 1 .. 254
# 1 gets remapped by olsrd to 0 UNSPECIFIED (1 is reserved for ICMP redirects)
# 2 KERNEL routes (not very wise to use)

# 4 STATIC 
# 8 .. 15 various routing daemons (gated, zebra, bird, & co)

# For testing purposes it may be nice to use another port for olsrd
# defaults to port 698 (IANA assigned olsr-port!)

# Should olsrd keep on running even if there are
