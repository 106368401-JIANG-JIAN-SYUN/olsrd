The config-verify program has the following purpose:

* Verify, that a stand-alone parser compiles
* The program can be used for config-laundering
* Compiles a DLL for loading with Win32-GUI (Switch)

Please note, that you should not execute the compiled
program as part of the makefiles, because this compilcates
adaptions for cross-compiling very much.
